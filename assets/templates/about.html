<h1>About this website</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
    This website hosts all of my writings and notes, or <em>articles</em> as called here, which I decided to share
    publicly. Part of it are summarizations of various books or their chapters, usually of technical nature. There are
    some guides and references which I made to make life and work easier. Some of the notes are just simple lists, even
    personal e.g.¬†my book library. There is no unifying theme - this work is mostly a product of my affinity with
    reading and writing down text with the goal of presenting concepts, condensing information and explaining core
    principles in a simpler way for some future time when knowledge might be needed. There is also joy to be found in
    writing itself, therefore I don‚Äôt expect all of the articles to be of technical or practical nature.
</p>

<h2>Articles &amp; Tags</h2>
<p>
    The main item served by the website is an <em>article</em>. I chose a general term to detach myself from commitment
    to any common structure. Articles are not all dedicated to a single topic, and are mostly independent; in fact, I
    expect that very few articles will be interlinked. There is a mechanism for grouping articles by topic: <em>tags</em>,
    which is a general name for keywords, themes or areas to which articles are dedicated. Each article has at least one
    tag assigned. This allows for categorization, which is only a more free form of inter-linking. The concepts of
    <em>articles</em> and <em>tags</em> are deeply baked in the design of the website, to the point that even the standard
     supporting pages like <em>Home</em> and <em>About</em> are internally stored as articles with the <em>meta</em> tag
     assigned to them.
</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>
    This is a bilingual website, but not in the way in which all articles are written in two languages, but in a way
    where most articles are written in English and a minority is written in Serbian. If the context was more fitting for
    an article in Serbian, I wrote it in Serbian. Also, in cases where the article is a product of digitalization of
    written notes, I kept the original language, which is mostly Serbian. Articles written in Serbian are tagged with the
    <em>sr-lang</em> tag.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The search function is not implemented yet. The search box is there, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything at the moment (except making the website look prettier).</li>
    <li>Auto-hidden side menu on small viewports has functionality issues in desktop computer browsers, although it doesn‚Äôt experience any issues on mobile device browsers.</li>
